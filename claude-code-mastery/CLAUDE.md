# Claude Code Mastery

This skill teaches best practices for using Claude Code CLI effectively.

Read and follow `SKILL.md` in this directory for complete instructions.

## Quick Summary

1. **Context is king** — manage it aggressively with `/clear`, `/compact`, and subagents
2. **Explore → Plan → Implement → Verify** — the 4-phase workflow for non-trivial tasks
3. **Be specific** — include files, constraints, and verification criteria in prompts
4. **Use subagents** — keep research out of main context
5. **Headless mode** — `claude -p` for automation and CI/CD

See `references/` for deep dives on memory, subagents, and headless automation.
